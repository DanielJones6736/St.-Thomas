Competition Template
---

Typical competition program


```
Why is this so hard to change btw?
This is similar to Robot_code (the original competition program) 
but with an actual auton and a GUI for choosing the auton (is this true future me?)

Main at the bottom (not mine but pre generated) to define what the autonomous and user_control is (so competition from judges works)
Pre_auton is supposed to be a GUI 
Auton is broken down into a switch statement with different autons shown from the onenote
User control is essentially what the automatic thing would have made but this version won't load it or something

There are a lot of functions that are meant to help the above functions
